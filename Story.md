Long time ago there was a dense jungle, in that jungle there lived a rabbit and a turtle. The rabbit was very fast and turtle was a bit slow. The rabbit used to make fun of turtle. Once the turtle got very angry and challanged the rabbit for a race, and the winner will get free food from the loser for a year.
